      <description>THIS IS NOT THE TAYLOR PRINT SHOP. We cannot accept the discount coupons/forms that they provide. Please contact the University Press at x85218 or visit them (by the TU Post Office) if you have a coupon and need a poster printed. 
The CSE Dept is happy to provide large format printing for our students. We can print up to 42&amp;rdquo; wide by any length. New for 2017: We are using semi-gloss coated paper, which makes your prints look much nicer.</description>

      <description>FAQ  How can I transfer my AP or dual credit classes?
 What&amp;rsquo;s a double major?
  Double majors are for people who are interested in studying more than one major. Taylor University allows students to declare any combination of minors and majors. Be sure that there is adequate overlap between the two majors so that you can finish in time! Also, be aware that there is a 160 credit hour cap.</description>

&amp;nbsp;
What do I say? Great literature is supposed to have a catchy first line. Moby Dick begins, “Call me Ishmael.” But I’m not sure that I’m up to great literature. And my name’s not Ishmael. Should I write something profound? Something frivolous? What does one say about oneself in this sort of situation?</description>

      <description>What is Systems? Systems is not a minor in Computer Science. The goal of the Systems curriculum is to help students recognize that the world is filled with systems (like educational, distribution, and manufacturing systems). It is the processes inhabiting these systems that produce value and help organizations achieve high performance. Our graduates are enjoying careers at enterprises of all sizes, including global consulting companies.

      <description>Sometimes alumni Ashley Crutcher designs websites that convince people to buy products,
like guacamole. But sometimes her goal is more serious, like convincing people to follow Jesus.
   At Taylor University, the Computer Science &amp;amp; Engineering (CSE) department is more than just a section of the science building. We have our own community on the second floor of the environmentally sustainable Euler Science Complex that flourishes as a learning environment.</description>

  The Taylor Satellite (TSAT) is a student-developed dual Cube-Sat Unit (4 x 4 x 8 inches) nanosatellite participating in NASA’s ELANA-5 (Educational Launch of Nanosatellites). TSAT was selected by NASA in a competitive program with other universities and was the only undergraduate program chosen. TSAT is short for Taylor, Technology, and TEST – Satellite.</description>
