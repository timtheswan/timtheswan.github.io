</a> </div>

<p>Zach Alford graduated from Taylor in 2016 with a Computer Science major, and Mathematics minor.</p>

<p>Zach appreciates how his Taylor education gave him skills integral to future development, both in his field and out. Academically, Zach learned attention for accuracy, cognitive persistence, how to work in groups, and valuable problem-solving skills. In Taylor&rsquo;s liberal arts education, Zach learned how to effectively express himself, both in conversation and in writing.</p>

<p>Spiritual development was an integral aspect of Zach&rsquo;s Taylor education. &ldquo;Taylor’s discipleship experiences and religion courses allowed me to taste and see God’s grace and justice, the pleasure of walking with Him daily, and to hope in something bigger than myself.&rdquo; Zach says his most valuable takeout from Taylor was when Phil Vischer of VeggieTales <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4c8kiI4V6U&amp;t=442s">talked at Chapel</a>. &ldquo;I learned how happiness is God&rsquo;s invention and that by seeking Him I find happiness along the way (Psalm 16:11, Hebrews 11:6).&rdquo;</p>

<p>Zach fondly recalls the opportunities he had at Taylor. He lived on the 3rd floor of Samuel Morris Hall (also known as &ldquo;The Brotherhood&rdquo;). His first classroom experience resulted from a spring break missions trip. Zach enjoyed his interactions with his peers and professors. One of his favorite experiences was the opportunity to volunteer at the Red Barn, a youth ministry for struggling students at a nearby high school.</p>

<p>Now living in Douglasville, Georgia, Zach is a math teacher at Chapel Hill Middle School. In June of 2019, Zach completed his Masters of Arts in Teaching at Mercer University as a <a href="https://woodrow.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/GA-TF-2018-Release-FINAL.pdf">Woodrow Wilson Teaching Fellow</a>. &ldquo;Teaching is a challenging but rewarding profession! I enjoy watching young minds grow and become confident with mathematics; the growth will serve them in many stages of life&rdquo;</p>

</a> </div> >-->

<p>Grant Hollis graduated from Taylor in 2004 with a Bachelors of Science in Computer Science, Systems, a concentration on Intelligent Systems, and a minor in Theater Arts.</p>

<p>While at Taylor, Grant learned how to define goals, organize himself to create a solid route to completion, communicate that to others, and celebrate upon achievement. Grant greatly values how Taylor&rsquo;s education prepared him for the workplace: &ldquo;It serves as the foundation for my career.  Everything I have learned since Taylor seems like an extension to some aspect of my education there.  Taylor CSE was great at enabling me to learn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Grant&rsquo;s favorite project while at Taylor was working on a swarm intelligence simulation for his Senior project along with Nathan Ehresman. Their project concluded as FishSim, which simulated schools of fish. &ldquo;The project was really challenging, and it really helped develop research methodology that I use in my job now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Since graduating, Grant has lived in the Washington DC Metro area to work with Lockheed Martin ATL as a Principal Software Engineer. He also loves to spend his time running, reading books, and telling stories.</p>

<p>Grant describes a career in computer science as one of constant learning. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m learning new skills seemingly every day to either learn how a piece of software that I didn&rsquo;t write works or determine how a piece of software I&rsquo;m going to write will work.&rdquo;</p>

            <p>Ashley does UX design for InterVarsity</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>
</a> </div>

<p>Ashley Crutcher, class of 2013, graduated with a B.S. in Digital Media - Systems. She and her husband live in Madison, Wisconsin, both working for InterVarsity Christian Fellowship, Ashely as a UX (User Experience) designer, and her husband as a software developer.</p>

<p>Ashley cites her 2 CSE missions trips and Code-A-Thon as the most transformative experiences of her time at Taylor. She also values having had an academic adviser to observe her strengths and guide her. &ldquo;I never would have seen the designer and systems thinker in me until Dr. Brandle nudged me in that direction.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After graduating from Taylor, Ashely worked with <a href="https://globalmediaoutreach.com/">Global Media Outreach</a> as web developer before transitioning to <a href="https://ansira.com/">Ansira</a> to develop her design skills. In 2016, she began working for InterVarsity. <a href="https://intervarsity.org/">InterVarsity</a> is a college campus ministry working to establish Christian communities in the thousands of campus across the U.S. that have none. She encourages students to consider InterVarsity as place to intern.</p>

<p>While it can be easy for colleges to stay in the academic world, Ashley appreciates Taylor CSE&rsquo;s attention to teaching for industry application. &ldquo;Once for a work project, I pulled out my ISA homework and referenced it. When I gave my department director the documentation, he said it was the best he had ever seen, thanks Dr. Nurkkala!&rdquo; As a designer, Ashley values her background in software development, &ldquo;the more you know about disciplines adjacent to yours, the better co-worker and collaborator you will be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Outside work, &ldquo;I like to cuddle with my fur-kiddos (1 cat, 2 dogs), knit, ring handbells, and think too much about everything. I like to joke that I am a grandma in a millennial’s body!&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="stephen-gilliland">Stephen Gilliland</h2>

<hr />

<p>After graduating from Taylor in 2014 with a major in Computer Engineering, Stephen Gilliland moved to Tucson, Arizona, to work as a Software Engineer at Raytheon Missile Systems. where he has since been promoted to Senior Software Engineer.</p>

<p>Being able to participate in the ELEO-SAT (Extremely Low Earth Orbit Satellite) project with Taylor CSE served as great preparation for the work on missile systems Stephen now does every day. &ldquo;Working on multiple aspects of a relatively complex embedded system (circuit design, PCB layout, microchip programming, interfaces) helped prepare me to understand the very complex systems I work on now&rdquo;</p>

<p>Outside of work, Stephen likes to spend his free time serving with his church, playing ultimate frisbee, and having spirited discussions with his wife about random topics. He and his wife, Michelle, have been married since December 2015. Michelle is an accountant and business analyst with a passion for combating sex trafficking.</p>

<p>Stephen can attest to the value of advanced computer courses, which provided him a solid foundation of skills for his workplace projects. &ldquo;The Intro to Computer Systems, Operating Systems, Microcomputer Interfacing, and Data Communications classes were particularly helpful for what I do, as well as the big junior and senior projects.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="jeremy-erickson">Jeremy Erickson</h2>

</figure>
</a> </div>

<p>Jeremy Erickson graduated from Taylor in 2009 with a B.A. in Math and a B.S in Computer Science, on the Scientific Computing track. He earned a Ph.D. at UNC Chapel Hill. Jeremy&rsquo;s research topic was Real-Time Scheduling: Managing Tardiness Bounds and Overload in Soft Real-Time Systems. He now works for Google in Madison, Wisconson.</p>

<p>When going into graduate school, Jeremy appreciated being well prepared by his degree requirements while at Taylor. &ldquo;I did not have to take any additional background courses as many incoming Ph.D. students do, and I felt prepared equally well with any of my peers in both theoretical and systems-oriented courses.&rdquo;</p>

<p>You can find Jeremy&rsquo;s work in Google Earth, where he improved it&rsquo;s performance during his first summer internship with Google in 2011. This resulted in a <a href="https://www.cs.unc.edu/~anderson/papers/rtas12c.pdf">publication</a> that he presented at the at the 18th Real-Time and Embedded Technology and Applications Symposium in Beijing, China. In 2012, Jeremy received the overall Best Paper award at the 24th Euromicro Conference on Real-Time Systems (2012) with a <a href="https://www.cs.unc.edu/~anderson/papers/ecrts12c.pdf">paper on optimizing G-EDF-like scheduling</a>.</p>
