Where are you currently living?  Washington DC Metro Area

What are you currently doing professionally?  Principal Software Engineer at Lockheed Martin ATL

What is a career in Computer Science like?  Learning new skills seemingly every day to either learn how a piece of software that I didn’t write really works or determine how a piece of software that I am going to write is going to work

How did studying Computer Science at Taylor prepare you for the workplace?  My Taylor computer science education – especially the Systems curriculum – serves as the foundation for my career.  Everything I have learned since Taylor seems like an extension to some aspect of my education there.  Taylor CSE was great at enabling me to learn whatever I have needed to learn for any specific project.

What do you like to do in your free time?  Run, read books, and tell stories.

What is the most valuable thing you learned at Taylor?  How to define quality, organize myself well enough to understand the incremental waypoints on the path to quality, communicate with teammates about what is quality, measure our progress toward quality, and celebrate when we have achieved it.

Cool opportunities you got while at Taylor?  On the computer science side, one of my favorite projects was my senior research project on swarm intelligence that ended up creating schooling virtual fish.  (I did this project together with Nathan Ehresman.)  The project was really challenging, and it really helped develop my research methodology that I use in my job now.  On the theater arts side, I was able to study improv theater at Oxford University through the Oxford Study Program.
