      <description>Faculty and Staff    The Computer Science and Engineering faculty and staff are a group of highly qualified professionals with expertise and experiences that include software engineering, artificial intelligence, leadership in major corporations, ethics in technology, and computing standards in tax codes. They each value interaction with students both inside and outside of the classroom.
The faculty and staff care about the students as mentors and friends. Their conversations can range anywhere from the classic Star Wars/Star Trek/Avengers talk to deep theology or philosophy.</description>
