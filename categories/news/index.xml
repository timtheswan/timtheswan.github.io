  The winners of GameJam Spring 2019
    Twenty-four hours is not a lot of time. But for 20 students, it is just enough to create a video game.
Eight teams competed in the 2019 spring Game Jam. They had from April 4 - 6 to find out the theme, design the levels and program a working game.</description>

This week eight students ventured with me to Purdue University in West Lafayette, IN, to attend the 19th annual CERIAS Security Symposium. As a graduate student at Purdue I was heavily involved with CERIAS, so the trip was both highly relevant to our students and a good chance for me to reconnect with cybersecurity colleagues.
Symposium presenters and panelists are cybersecurity experts from academia, industry, and government.</description>

  (L to R) Professor Bill Bauson stands with senior Justin Theien, chief engineer for the ThinSat satellite project.
    Taylor University students hope to launch a new ThinSat satellite in October 2018.
The group was first brought together by former Professor Emeritus of Engineering and Physics Hank Voss. Voss was involved in space science at a previous job, and it was there that he encountered a whole field of study called nanosatellites.</description>

      <description>Reposted from Taylor University Site
    Aerospace and defense industry company Lockheed Martin has granted a $75,000 renewal of a grant to the Taylor University Computer Science (CSE) Department as part of a multi-year partnership to create cybersecurity solutions. The grant comes a little more than a year after the preliminary $100,000 grant from Lockheed Martin Advanced Technology Labs for research work done in 2017.
According to Taylor faculty members, a number of Taylor CSE students and faculty worked on the project during the 2017 spring and fall semesters, and also during the summer.</description>

    It all started with TWEET. And no, not the 280-character kind. TWEET stands for Taylor Women Engaging in Engineering and Technology, and those women of Taylor&amp;rsquo;s science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) created a program to get young girls in the community involved with science.
On Tuesday, March 6, one such meeting was held in Euler.</description>

  The importance of the new cybersecurity major becomes a greater issue as world technology progresses.
    On Feb. 2, Taylor University welcomed Grant Hollis (&amp;lsquo;04), lead research scientist with Lockheed Martin Advanced Technology Laboratories (LM ATL), to speak on current events in cybersecurity and to raise awareness for Taylor&amp;rsquo;s new major.
Hollis worked part-time as a system administrator for Taylor&amp;rsquo;s computer science department.</description>

  A few students in the Software Reverse Engineering and Analysis class, pictured above, prepared for class by spending a day in Washington D.C..
    It&amp;rsquo;s been created and has a list of classes established, but Taylor&amp;rsquo;s cybersecurity major doesn&amp;rsquo;t officially exist-at least, not yet.
Current students will be allowed to enroll in the major when the catalogue comes out in August, and incoming students can declare it now.</description>

  Taylor students compete remotely in a computer hacking competition.
    Last Saturday, four Taylor teams competed remotely against other universities in a cybersecurity capture the flag competition hosted by Buena Vista University (BVU) in Storm Lake, Iowa.
The four Taylor teams met in Euler 218&amp;frasl;219 from 10:45 p.m. to 9 p.m. to commence the competition. They joined the other eight teams from across the United States via Google Hangouts to chat.</description>
