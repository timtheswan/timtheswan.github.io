</a> </div>

<p>Courtney Masters is a Sophomore studying Computer Science - Digital Media B.A. She is currently most interested in a career in web development or software engineering after she graduates in 2022.</p>

<p>Courtney heard about Taylor&rsquo;s Computer Science department from her older brother and other friends. &ldquo;I was particularly attracted to the digital media program because it incorporated design and film along with programming.&rdquo; She chose to go to Taylor after falling in love with the Taylor community, and after hearing that it had a well designed Computer Science program.</p>

<p>Coming into Taylor&rsquo;s Computer Science program with &ldquo;absolutely no Computer Science experience&rdquo;, Courtney was able to quickly get up to speed through hard work and her teachers&rsquo; unassuming teaching. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid to ask for help, especially early on. The hardest lesson in CS for me to learn was to admit when I didn&rsquo;t understand something, it&rsquo;s easy to just nod your head and pretend that you get it when you don&rsquo;t. That will hurt you down the road.&rdquo;</p>

<p>You won&rsquo;t have to be on campus long to hear that Taylor promotes intentional community. Courtney loves how Taylor encourages students to foster good relationships with everyone they interact with, from those they live with, to their academic peers and professors. She also appreciates how Taylor&rsquo;s residence and academic community is not divided by age. &ldquo;Having the opportunity to pour into younger friends while being mentored by older friends is a really unique aspect of community that Taylor fosters.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Besides learning to avoid 8 AM classes when at all possible, one of the most valuable lessons Courtney has gotten out of Taylor so far is to &ldquo;take life by the reigns.&rdquo; Instead of passively waiting for opportunities to come, take initiative. &ldquo;Apply for a job that you might not get or ask someone you donâ€™t really know that well out to coffee, you might become great friends!&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="drew-anderson">Drew Anderson</h2>

</figure>
</a> </div>

<p>Drew Anderson is a double major in Math and Computer Science B.A. He plans to graduate in the Spring of 2020, 3 years after starting college, and begin graduate school for math.</p>

<p>Bringing a substantial amount of credits and computer science education with him from high school, Drew was immediately well on his way in a computer science degree. The Computer Science department has ensured that he learn at an appropriate pace in the midst of his unconventional academic situation.</p>

<p>Like many who come to Taylor, Drew&rsquo;s favorite aspect of Taylor is the community, &ldquo;At Taylor, away from my family, I have experienced a community that has come around me like a family and gained friendships that I hope will last a lifetime.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The most valuable lesson Drew has learned at Taylor is the importance of taking responsibility over time management. It&rsquo;s important to ensure all work gets done, but it&rsquo;s equally important to have time for rest.</p>

<p>Drew advises to never underestimate the importance of your work in class, &ldquo;No matter how worthless something may seem, there will come a time where you will want to use it and need to know how to do it&rdquo;. Additionally, he encourages not to forget how valuable a resource professors are, &ldquo;they want to help you, don&rsquo;t be afraid to approach them and ask for help.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="alison-bell">Alison Bell</h2>

<div class="insertL" > <a href="/img/articles/students/alison_bell3.jpg" target="none"><figure>

            <p>Alison grew up in Iraq</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>
</a> </div>

<p>Alison Bell is a Senior, and plans to graduate with a B.A. in Computer Science in the Spring of 2020.</p>

<p>After growing up as a missionary kid in Iraq, Alison chose to study Computer Science at Taylor. &ldquo;I chose Computer Science because I wanted to go into software development, and I enjoyed problem-solving and working with computers.&rdquo; Alison had taken AP computer science, and had some experience with professional web development. &ldquo;Taylor has a strong Computer Science program with classes in many different areas of CS, and has a focus on community, service, and missions, so I went there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Alison&rsquo;s favorite aspect of Taylor University is that &ldquo;the professors really care about you and donâ€™t just want to help you learn; they also care about you personally and spiritually.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As a female and MK in a field that typically doesn&rsquo;t have many others, Alison says it can sometimes be more difficult to connect, but &ldquo;there are also quite a few other women and MKs in the major here at Taylor that Iâ€™ve gotten to know well, and I feel like the professors are always looking out for me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her favorite computer science project has been working on a platform for speakers of minority languages to collaborate on verifying translated recordings of the Bible with Wycliffe Associates. She plans on going into a career of software development for Christian nonprofits.</p>

<div class="insertR" > <a href="/img/articles/students/alison_bell2.jpg" target="none"><figure>
    <img src="/img/articles/students/alison_bell2.jpg"
         alt="Alison interning with Google" width="250px"/> <figcaption>
            <p>Alison interning with Google</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>
</a> </div>

<p>Alison believes that Taylor gave her a unique Computer Science education. &ldquo;Since Taylor is a liberal arts school, I got to see my fellow CS majors in Bible classes, philosophy and ethics classes, and other settings beyond CS. Itâ€™s normal for the professors and students to talk about things far beyond computer science and to have more holistic relationships that arenâ€™t just focused on classes. The professors care about more than just making you a good computer scientist, but also helping you become a person who will use computer science to help others and live a life that glorifies God. The farther Iâ€™ve gone in the computer science industry, the more Iâ€™ve come to appreciate this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>To those just starting in Computer Science, Alison offers this encouragement: &ldquo;Itâ€™s normal to feel stuck or confused. Computer science is all about problem-solving and organizing complexity, and that means you might have to bang your head against a problem for a while or do a lot of research before figuring out how to solve it. Youâ€™re not stupid or unqualified â€“ even the most amazing professional software engineers Iâ€™ve worked with still get stuck and confused!&rdquo;</p>
