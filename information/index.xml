      <description>THIS IS NOT THE TAYLOR PRINT SHOP. We cannot accept the discount coupons/forms that they provide. Please contact the University Press at x85218 or visit them (by the TU Post Office) if you have a coupon and need a poster printed. 
The CSE Dept is happy to provide large format printing for our students. We can print up to 42&amp;rdquo; wide by any length. New for 2017: We are using semi-gloss coated paper, which makes your prints look much nicer.</description>

      <description>FAQ  What kind of computer or software will be needed?  Most computers within a decade old will suffice. Students do most of the work on lab computers, where all needed software is already installed. That said, most of the needed software is available for free. Once you get your Taylor email address, you will have access to Microsoft Office, and the entire JetBrains development suite , among other things.</description>

      <description>What is Systems?   What in the world is Accenture selling? The basic answer is “systems.” Accenture’s mission is to help their clients achieve “high performance.”  Accenture, like the Systems curriculum often does
this by helping their clients hone their business
processes or implement new technologies.
   Systems is not a minor in Computer Science. The goal of the Systems curriculum is to help students recognize that the world is filled with systems (like educational, distribution, and manufacturing systems).</description>

      <description>Sometimes alumni Ashley Crutcher designs websites that convince people to buy products,
like guacamole. But sometimes her goal is more serious, like convincing people to follow Jesus.
   At Taylor University, the Computer Science &amp;amp; Engineering (CSE) department is more than just a section of the science building. We have our own community on the second floor of the environmentally sustainable Euler Science Complex that flourishes as a learning environment.</description>
