      <description>Bio When I was a little kid, I told my dad I wanted to be an architect just like him. We would go into business together and call it “Lehrian &amp;amp; Father.” Only I didn’t pursue architecture. I did math instead.
My goal was not to work in IT as a career. Then IWU’s IT Dept snagged me shortly after graduation. That launched me into an IT career path that eventually resulted in working as a sysadmin.</description>

      <description>Bio I was born into a family of soldiers, missionaries and physicians. I spent most of my life in a Northern Virginia suburb, but I have traveled extensively.My faith has played a central role in my life. I was saved young and have found purpose and joy in my relationship with Christ.
I have enjoyed technology since my first DOS machine at the age of 5. I also have broad interests in most of the liberal arts, but I especially enjoy mathematics, physics, philosophy and political science.</description>

      <description>Bio I’ve been working as the Program Assistant for the Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) department since fall 2011. For nine years I was the only sister of three older brothers, so I know how to handle anything these guys can throw at me. Prior to working for the CSE department, I worked on the first floor of Nussbaum Science Center as the Program Assistant for the School of Natural &amp;amp; Applied Sciences.</description>

      <description>Bio When I set out to become a professor in 2004, I identified Taylor University specifically as the place that I would like to teach. I did not realize at the time how unlikely it was that I would actually get to work at my first choice (but here I sit). Though I was not a student at Taylor, I grew up in nearby Van Buren and was surrounded by community members involved with Taylor.</description>

      <description>Bio As an elementary education major at Taylor University, I always thought I would someday like to be a professor. I never thought I would return to Taylor via the Computer Science and Engineering department!
After teaching in a public school in Indianapolis for six years, I decided to go back to graduate school. While working on my M.S. degree in Instructional Systems Technology at Indiana University, I realized how much I liked learning about the appropriate uses of technology in an educational setting.</description>

      <description>Bio In fall 2014, I started as an assistant professor teaching computer graphics and core Computer Science courses. I find graphics fascinating because it creatively combines many disciplines—physics, math, data structures, and art—and produces images that are simple, yet awe-inspiring and rich with details.
The past few years have been a whirlwind of excitement for and blessings on my family, and looking back it’s obvious that God has led us to where we are now.</description>

      <description>Bio What can I say that’s enlightening? I’m not as funny as Dr. Brandle, so I think I’ll just be plain and tell you a bit about myself.
I’m a Taylor Computer Science and Engineering grad (Dec. ’94), so I’ve been involved in the department since 1991. I took a couple years off to work at Argonne National Laboratory before attending Northwestern University for my PhD. Technically, I’m a Computer Engineer, so I work with the Physics department to make sure that program is up to snuff.</description>

      <description>Bio What do I say? Great literature is supposed to have a catchy first line. Moby Dick begins, “Call me Ishmael.” But I’m not sure that I’m up to great literature. And my name’s not Ishmael. Should I write something profound? Something frivolous? What does one say about oneself in this sort of situation?
I wish to serve God in all aspects of my life. That commission includes my professional field and my job.</description>

      <description>Bio I’m at Taylor because I want to help train and mentor excellent computer scientists and engineers who are also dedicated followers of Christ. In addition, as a member of the Center for Missions Computing, I want to leverage the intellectual horsepower and spiritual maturity of the students at Taylor to help solve practical computing problems for the global mission community.
To accomplish these goals, I plan to employ my educational and industrial experience.</description>

      <description>Bio I teach because I believe the Lord has called me to teaching and I deeply enjoy teaching and time spent with young people. Seeing students become excited about the field of computing is extremely gratifying. I love experiencing the “aha!” moments as students comprehend new concepts in computer science. I enjoy working with students to help them develop their analysis, design, programming, and debugging skills. I find these skills apply not only to programming, but also to other areas of life.</description>

      <description>Faculty and Staff    The Computer Science and Engineering faculty and staff are a group of highly qualified professionals with expertise and experiences that include software engineering, artificial intelligence, leadership in major corporations, ethics in technology, and computing standards in tax codes. They each value interaction with students both inside and outside of the classroom.
The faculty and staff care about the students as mentors and friends. Their conversations can range anywhere from the classic Star Wars/Star Trek/Avengers talk to deep theology or philosophy.</description>
