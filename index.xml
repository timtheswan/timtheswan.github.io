    Grant Hollis graduated from Taylor in 2004 with a Bachelors of Science in Computer Science, Systems, a concentration on Intelligent Systems, and a minor in Theater Arts.
While at Taylor, Grant learned how to define goals, organize himself to create a solid route to completion, communicate that to others, and celebrate upon achievement. Grant greatly values how Taylor&amp;rsquo;s education prepared him for the workplace: &amp;ldquo;It serves as the foundation for my career.</description>

    Courtney Masters is a Sophomore studying Computer Science - Digital Media B.A. She is currently most interested in a career in web development or software engineering after she graduates in 2022.
Courtney heard about Taylor&amp;rsquo;s Computer Science department from her older brother and other friends. &amp;ldquo;I was particularly attracted to the digital media program because it incorporated design and film along with programming.</description>

      <description>Whose AI will win?
   In their first year, Computer Science students will take both COS 120, and COS 121, which teaches students to code from square one. Regardless of the experience students come in with, they will be given the foundational skills necessary code their own AIs (artificial intelligence) to play games, like Checkers, Risk, and Battleships.
COS 120, Introduction to Computational Problem Solving, teaches students essential coding principles, and gives them their first taste solving real world computational problems using Python.</description>

      <description>FAQ  How can I transfer my AP or dual credit classes?
 What&amp;rsquo;s a double major?
  Double majors are for people who are interested in studying more than one major. Taylor University allows students to declare any combination of minors and majors. Be sure that there is adequate overlap between the two majors so that you can finish in time! Also, be aware that there is a 160 credit hour cap.</description>

      <description>Associate Professor
   When I set out to become a professor in 2004, I identified Taylor University specifically as the place that I would like to teach. I did not realize at the time how unlikely it was that I would actually get to work at my first choice (but here I sit). Though I was not a student at Taylor, I grew up in nearby Van Buren and was surrounded by community members involved with Taylor.</description>

      <description>Associate Professor
   As an elementary education major at Taylor University, I always thought I would someday like to be a professor. I never thought I would return to Taylor viaÂ the Computer Science and Engineering department!
&amp;nbsp;
After teaching in a public school in Indianapolis for six years, I decided to go back to graduate school. While working on my M.S. degree in Instructional Systems Technology at Indiana University, I realized how much I liked learning about the appropriate uses of technology in anÂ educational setting.</description>

      <description>Assistant Professor and Department Co-chair
   In fall 2014, I started as an assistant professor teaching computer graphics and core Computer Science courses. I find graphics fascinating because it creatively combines many disciplinesâphysics, math, data structures, and artâand produces images that are simple, yet awe-inspiring and rich with details.
&amp;nbsp;
The past few years have been a whirlwind of excitement for and blessings on my family, and looking back itâs obvious that God has led us to where we are now.</description>

   What can I say thatâs enlightening? Iâm not as funny as Dr. Brandle, so I think Iâll just be plain and tell you a bit about myself.
&amp;nbsp;
Iâm a Taylor Computer Science and Engineering grad (Dec. â94), so Iâve been involved in the department since 1991. I took a couple years off to work at Argonne National Laboratory before attending Northwestern University for my PhD.</description>

   &amp;nbsp;
What do I say? Great literature is supposed to have a catchy first line. Moby Dick begins, âCall me Ishmael.â But Iâm not sure that Iâm up to great literature. And my nameâs not Ishmael. Should I write something profound? Something frivolous? What does one say about oneself in this sort of situation?
&amp;nbsp;
I wish to serve God in all aspects of my life.</description>

      <description>Associate Professor
   Iâm at Taylor because I want to help train and mentor excellent computer scientists and engineers who are also dedicated followers of Christ. In addition, as a member of the Center for Missions Computing, I want to leverage the intellectual horsepower and spiritual maturity of the students at Taylor to help solve practical computing problems for the global mission community.
&amp;nbsp;
To accomplish these goals, I plan to employ my educational and industrial experience.</description>

      <description>What is Systems? Systems is not a minor in ComputerÂ Science. The goal of the Systems curriculum is to help students recognize that the world is filled with systems (like educational, distribution, and manufacturing systems). It is the processes inhabiting these systems that produce value and help organizations achieve high performance. Our graduates are enjoying careers at enterprises of all sizes, including global consulting companies.

TSAT was selected by NASA in a competitive program with other universities and was the only undergraduate program chosen. TSAT is short for Taylor, Technology, and TEST â Satellite.</description>

This week eight students ventured with me to Purdue University in West Lafayette, IN, to attend the 19th annual CERIAS Security Symposium. As a graduate student at Purdue I was heavily involved with CERIAS, so the trip was both highly relevant to our students and a good chance for me to reconnect with cybersecurity colleagues.
Symposium presenters and panelists are cybersecurity experts from academia, industry, and government.</description>

      <description>Reposted from Taylor University Site
Aerospace and defense industry company Lockheed Martin has granted a $75,000 renewal of a grant to the Taylor University Computer Science (CSE) Department as part of a multi-year partnership to create cybersecurity solutions. The grant comes a little more than a year after the preliminary $100,000 grant from Lockheed Martin Advanced Technology Labs for research work done in 2017.
According to Taylor faculty members, a number of Taylor CSE students and faculty worked on the project during the 2017 spring and fall semesters, and also during the summer.</description>

      <description>Feature Selection for Malware Classification    Mitchell Mays Noah Drabinsky Dr. Stefan Brandle Fri, Apr 28, 2017
In applying machine learning to malware identification, different types of features have proven to be successful. These features have also been tested with different kinds of classification methodologies and have had varying degrees of success. Every time a new machine learning methodology is introduced for classifying malware, there is the potential for increasing the overall quality of malware classification in the field.</description>

      <description>Improved User Security Through Graphical Feedback Justice Juraschek Dannie M. Stanley Wed, Jul 27, 2016
A plethora of methods of being secure are available to end-users. However, there is a lack of adoption of those methods. We argue that one of the primary reasons for this is the absence of proper feedback within security-sensitive situations. We believe that a graphical representation of security-related consequences can positively influence security-sensitive user decisions.</description>

      <description>Improved Kernel Security Through Memory Layout Randomization  Dannie M. Stanley Dongyan Xu Eugene H. Spafford Fri, Dec 6, 2013 
The vast majority of hosts on the Internet, including mobile clients, are running on one of three major operating system families. Malicious operating system kernel software, such as the code introduced by a kernel rootkit, is strongly dependent on the organization of the victim operating system. Due to the lack of diversity of operating systems, attackers can craft a single kernel exploit that has the potential to infect millions of hosts.</description>
