Our worldview is impacted by technology in ways that are not recognized and, therefore, not critically evaluated, particularly with a Christian understanding. This course is designed to introduce students to the context of computation in their world. Through writing, discussions, and class assignments, students will gain an understanding of computing technology that goes beyond its use and explores the impact of technology on our world view. The context provided includes an introduction to the issues in our society associated with ethics and technology. Main topics addressed include: applying major ethical theories, intellectual property, privacy, and putting technology into context with a Christian perspective. </p>
