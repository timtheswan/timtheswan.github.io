      <description>THIS IS NOT THE TAYLOR PRINT SHOP. We cannot accept the discount coupons/forms that they provide. Please contact the University Press at x85218 or visit them (by the TU Post Office) if you have a coupon and need a poster printed. 
The CSE Dept is happy to provide large format printing for our students. We can print up to 42&amp;rdquo; wide by any length. New for 2017: We are using semi-gloss coated paper, which makes your prints look much nicer.</description>

      <description>FAQ  How can I transfer my AP or dual credit classes?
 What&amp;rsquo;s a double major?
  Double majors are for people who are interested in studying more than one major. Taylor University allows students to declare any combination of minors and majors. Be sure that there is adequate overlap between the two majors so that you can finish in time! Also, be aware that there is a 160 credit hour cap.</description>

      <description>Sometimes alumni Ashley Crutcher designs websites that convince people to buy products,
like guacamole. But sometimes her goal is more serious, like convincing people to follow Jesus.
   At Taylor University, the Computer Science &amp;amp; Engineering (CSE) department is more than just a section of the science building. We have our own community on the second floor of the environmentally sustainable Euler Science Complex that flourishes as a learning environment.</description>
