      <description>Associate Professor
   When I set out to become a professor in 2004, I identified Taylor University specifically as the place that I would like to teach. I did not realize at the time how unlikely it was that I would actually get to work at my first choice (but here I sit). Though I was not a student at Taylor, I grew up in nearby Van Buren and was surrounded by community members involved with Taylor.</description>

      <description>Associate Professor
   As an elementary education major at Taylor University, I always thought I would someday like to be a professor. I never thought I would return to Taylor via the Computer Science and Engineering department!
&amp;nbsp;
After teaching in a public school in Indianapolis for six years, I decided to go back to graduate school. While working on my M.S. degree in Instructional Systems Technology at Indiana University, I realized how much I liked learning about the appropriate uses of technology in an educational setting.</description>

      <description>Assistant Professor and Department Co-chair
   In fall 2014, I started as an assistant professor teaching computer graphics and core Computer Science courses. I find graphics fascinating because it creatively combines many disciplines—physics, math, data structures, and art—and produces images that are simple, yet awe-inspiring and rich with details.

The past few years have been a whirlwind of excitement for and blessings on my family, and looking back it’s obvious that God has led us to where we are now.</description>

      <description>Associate Professor
   What can I say that’s enlightening? I’m not as funny as Dr. Brandle, so I think I’ll just be plain and tell you a bit about myself.
&amp;nbsp;
I’m a Taylor Computer Science and Engineering grad (Dec. ’94), so I’ve been involved in the department since 1991. I took a couple years off to work at Argonne National Laboratory before attending Northwestern University for my PhD.</description>

   &amp;nbsp;
What do I say? Great literature is supposed to have a catchy first line. Moby Dick begins, “Call me Ishmael.” But I’m not sure that I’m up to great literature. And my name’s not Ishmael. Should I write something profound? Something frivolous? What does one say about oneself in this sort of situation?
&amp;nbsp;
I wish to serve God in all aspects of my life.</description>

      <description>Associate Professor
   I’m at Taylor because I want to help train and mentor excellent computer scientists and engineers who are also dedicated followers of Christ. In addition, as a member of the Center for Missions Computing, I want to leverage the intellectual horsepower and spiritual maturity of the students at Taylor to help solve practical computing problems for the global mission community.
&amp;nbsp;
To accomplish these goals, I plan to employ my educational and industrial experience.</description>

      <description>Faculty and Staff    The Computer Science and Engineering faculty and staff are a group of highly qualified professionals with expertise and experiences that include software engineering, artificial intelligence, leadership in major corporations, ethics in technology, and computing standards in tax codes. They each value interaction with students both inside and outside of the classroom.
The faculty and staff care about the students as mentors and friends. Their conversations can range anywhere from the classic Star Wars/Star Trek/Avengers talk to deep theology or philosophy.</description>
