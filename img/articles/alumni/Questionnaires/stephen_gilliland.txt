01Where are you currently living?  Tucson, AZ

What are you currently doing professionally? I have worked as a Software Engineer at Raytheon Missile Systems since graduation.

Describe your career since graduating from Taylor (achievements, awards, companies worked at, positions held, include links if applicable) See above, was promoted up to Senior Software Engineer recently.  

How did studying Computer Science at Taylor prepare you for the workplace? The computer engineering degree provided a broad foundation on which to build further skills necessary for workplace projects.  The Intro to Computer Systems, Operating Systems, Microcomputer Interfacing, and Data Communications classes were particularly helpful for what I do, as well as the big junior and senior projects.  

The satellite project also was great preparation for working on missile systems as there are many similarities. Working on multiple aspects of a relatively complex embedded system (circuit design, PCB layout, microchip programming, interfaces) helped prepare me to understand the very complex systems I work on now.  I learned a lot of what not to do on that project; I wish I could go back and tackle it again with what I know now.  

(If relevant) Please tell us about your spouse and children. I have been married to Michelle since Dec 2015.  She is an accountant/business analyst and has a passion for combatting sex trafficking.  

What do you like to do in your free time? Serving with my church, Ultimate Frisbee, and having spirited discussions with Michelle about random topics.

Cool opportunities you got while at Taylor? The satellite project was cool, even though ELEO-SAT never flew.
